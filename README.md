Finding the vibrational modes of a drum with a fractal shaped border.

This was an exam problem I had in Computational Physics class. The objective is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors describing the vibrations of a drum with a square Koch fractal shaped border. Everything is in a single Jupyter Notebook with ample comments and math.
